# use khans algo of topological sort which
# is applicable on adg.Thereâ€™s a simple proof
# to the above fact is that a DAG does not contain
# a cycle which means that all paths will be of
# finite length.Since S is the longest path there
# can be no incoming edge to u and no outgoing edge
# from v, if this situation had occurred then S
# would not have been the longest path
# => indegree(u) = 0 and outdegree(v) = 0
